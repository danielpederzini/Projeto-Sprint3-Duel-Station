            <b>Yu-Gi-Oh's Story</b>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                <i>Yu-Gi-Oh</i> is a trade card game franchise, posteriorly addapted to anime series and videogames. 
                The story takes place in a world where people use monster, magic and trap cards to duel against each other,
                wheter for fun or competition. However, there's an obscure and mystic past about the game, which few know
                about.

                It all started in ancient egypt, when kings and pharaohs used to play a very similar game, but with
                real monsters and spells. Lots of people died and whole cities were destroyed by the duels. Unhappy
                with that, a brave pharaoh called <i>Atem</i> prisioned the darkness and magic of the game in 7 artifacts,
                freeing the humans from the despair. Until...

            <p>
                Most of these artifacts fell into human hands, including the protagonist's <i>Yugi Muto</i> ones.
                After solving the puzzle of his artifact (<i>The Millenium Puzzle</i>), <i>Yugi</i> summoned in his body
                the spirit of <i>Atem</i>, the pharaoh which saved the world. The mission now is to prevent
                the darkness from the other artifacts to come out and spread destruction again.

            <b>My Story With Yu-Gi-Oh</b>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                My first contact with the anime was at 8 years old. I used to watch it on TV Globinho and imitate the characters
                (I always repeated the iconic protagonist's catchphrase '<i>It's time to duel!</i>'). The power of friendship,
                persistence and courage were some values the anime used to show a lot: It doesn't matter how difficult the situation
                was, or how terrifying the opponent was, <i>Yugi</i> never gave up, and his friends were always around to support him.
                I was fascinated by the strategies, plans and traps they came up, I even had my own deck, even though it was hard to
                find someone to play.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                Some time later, when I was 10 years old, my brother bougth a Yu-Gi-Oh game for PlayStation2, it was called
                <i>"Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists Of The Roses"</i>. The game was a mixture of strategy, positioning and space visualization,
                it was like a fusion between chess and fantasy, I felt like an actual duelist playing.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                A few weeks later, it became my favorite game. I started playing for hours, already knew most of the cards, had
                beatten all enemies several times and made nearly everything possible. This helped me on developing not only my
                logic, strategy and analysis skills, but also my persistence, determination and friendship valueing.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p>
                Nowadays, many years later, I still play my PlayStation2 game, and it feels really nostalgic to remeber everything
                I learned from that. Indeed, Yu-Gi-Oh changed my life and taught me never to give up.
